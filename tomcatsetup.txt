1) download and setup jdk
2) windows -> show view -> servers -> add new server -> download and tomcat -> double click -> select use tomcat installation save
3) right click on server -> start -> browser -> localhost:8080
4) goto tomcat/conf/tomcat users.xml -> uncomment user and change password to login onto tomcat server

servlet runs in tomcat
hence objects are created and destroyed by tomcat


-> servlet object is created once (1 instance, each diff request response has diff threads but same servlet instance)
-> request and response objects are created for each access 
-> request object (also contains all metadata required to understand about the request)
-> response object
-> req and res are created each time because -> stateless object
-> to save user data -> cookie(client side) and session (server side), servlet context
-> one session object for each user/machine
	=> objects available across requests
	=> for login sessions and shopping carts
	=> each request object has access to session object
-> servlet context across servlets and users i.e., across entire application
-> initialization code or common code for all users and whole application
-> Servlet Config is similar to servlet context but only specific to the servlet.
