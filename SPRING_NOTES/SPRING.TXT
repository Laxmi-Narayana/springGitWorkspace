SPRING FRAMEWORK -> MAKE APPLICATION LOOSELY COUPLED
THROUGH-> DEPENDENCY INJECTION AND INVERSION OF CONTROL

OBJECT CREATION AND MANAGEMENT BY SPRING

UI LAYER -> MVC
BUSINESS/SERVICES LAYER (SECURITY,TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT)
DATA ACCESS LAYER (SPRING JDBC AND ORM)

CONTROLLER => SERVICES => DAO

SPRING FRAMEWORK
SPRING CORE
	CORE 
	BEANS
	CONTEXT -> INHERTIS FROM BEANS, RESOURCE LOADING,INTERNALIZATION,EVENT PROPAGATION,TRANSPARENT CREATION OF CONTEXT, JAVA EE FEATURE,REMOTING,MESSAGNING
	SPEL -> QUERY AND MANIPULATE OBJECT GRAPH AT RUN TIME
	
	CORE AND BEANS => FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN, IOC AND DI

ASPECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
	AOP
	ASPECT -> METHOD INTERCEPTORS, POINT CUT
	INSTRUMENTATION
	MESSAGING

DATA ACCESS/INTEGRATION
	JDBC
	ORM
	JMS (JAVA MESSAGING SERVICES , PRODUCE AND CONSUME)
	OXM (OBJECT XML MAPPING)
	
WEB MODULE
	WEB
	PORTLET
	SERVLET
	WEBSOCKET
	
TEST
	UNIT TESTING
	INTEGRATION TESTING
	
SPRING IOC CONTAINER:
	OBJECT CREATION
	MEMORY MANGEMENT
	INJECT OBJECTS AS REQUIRED
	DESTROY
	
BEANS -> CLASSES MANAGED BY SPRING
CONFIGURATION -> DESIGN THE DEPENDENCY

HENCE THESE BEANS ARE INJECTED TO THE APPLICATION BASED ON CONFIGURATION

APPLICATION CONTEXT:
	CLASSPATHXMLAPPLICATIONCONTEXT
	ANNOTATIONCONFIGAPPLICATIONCONTEXT
	FILESYSTEMXMLAPPLICATIONCONTEXT

DEPENDENCY INJECTION:
	CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION
	SETTER INJECTION

	BYNAME
	BYTYPE
	
FIRST BYTYPE IF AMBIGUITY THEN BYNAME EVEN AMBIGUITY THEN ERROR
	
WHILE DECLARING BEANS -> WE SPECIFY THE PROPERTIES 

SUPPORT OF DATA TYPES FOR INJECTION:
PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
COLLECTION TYPE
REFERENCE TYPES
